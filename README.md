## WHAT WE'RE DOING

We'll be continuing with the TDD demo.
I've got some resources for those interested in starting down the dark path of improving your coding skills; no, none of this is on the final.

## RESOURCES

### Uncle Bob

Uncle Bob Videos. They're unique. And pricey - but there are two free ones that give you a taste of what they're like. If you're serious at all about being a coding craftsman/woman, you should look at these.

### Lynda

Lynda.com offers a ton of training in a variety of areas - for a cost. But if you have a Calgary Public Library card (you **do** have one, right? getting one is free...), you have Lynda access for free: https://calgarylibrary.ca/news/free-online-courses-with-lynda-com/

There is an excellent introductory-level Lynda training video on TDD here: https://www.lynda.com/Software-Development-tutorials/Programming-Foundations-Test-Driven-Development/124398-2.html?org=calgarylibrary.ca

### Keeping those skills sharp

There are numerous sites out there where you can hone your programming skills for free. I'll suggest two here:

- https://exercism.io/ 
- https://www.codewars.com (by the Qualified folks...don't hold that against 'em!)
-
